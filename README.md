I have made a simple GUI program that tracks NBA stats up until the mid-point of the season. There are no automatic updates in this program so I would manually have to change the stats in Python. The first window is a team selection window with the NBA logo at the top. I put in a drop-down menu for you to select the team you want to view along with a select button. Once the select button is clicked it will open a new window for that team the displays the “Wins”, “Losses”, “Points per Game”, and “Points Allowed per Game”.  I included a close button on the second window so you can return to the original window and select another team.
